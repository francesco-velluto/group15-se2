## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- **Number of stories committed vs. done:** 
  we committed to do 2 stories, which are 'Get Ticket' (Story #1) and 'Get estimated time' (Story #3), and we managed to complete both of them.

- **Total points committed vs. done:**
  we committed to do 4 points (3 of Get Ticket story + 1 of Get estimated time) and we did all of 4 points.

- **Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team):** 
  we planned to spend 48 hours (8 hours for each one of the 6 team members) plus additional 4 hours for planning and we spent 51h 20m in total.

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   10    |        | 26h        |   24h 20m    |
| _#1_   |    9    |   3    | 18h 30m    |   20h 30m    |
| _#3_   |    4    |   1    | 7h 30m     |   6h 30m     |

- **Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):**
  - Average Estimate: 2h 15m
  - Average Actual: 2h 14m
  - Standard Deviation Estimate: 1h 3m
  - Standard Deviation Actual: 57m

- **Total task estimation error ratio: (sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent) - 1:**
  - 0.06

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- **Unit Testing:**
  - **Total hours estimated:** 8h
  - **Total hours spent:** 7h
  - **Nr of automated unit test cases:** 23
  - **Coverage (if available):** 84% Back-end | Unavailable Front-end
- **E2E testing:**
  - **Total hours estimated:** 8h
  - **Total hours spent:** 7h
- **Code review:**
  - **Total hours estimated:** we didn't estimate the time for code review 
  - **Total hours spent:** since we didn't estimate the time for code review, we didn't track any time on it
  


## ASSESSMENT

- **What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?**
  - The main issue in estimation was caused by the fact we didn't estimate the time for code review.
  - We estimated more time than what we planned for the organization and planning of the sprint.
  - Some tasks were overestimated because we thought they would be more difficult than they actually were.

- **What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?**
  - We learned that we should estimate the time for code review.
  - We learned that the new opened issue should be in the next sprint.
  - We learned that we need to organize better the speech during the demo and the presentation of the sprint.
  - We learned that tests are important to deliver a good quality product and the fact that we planned and spent a lot of time in tests was a positive lesson.
  - We learned that we should estimate the time required to review the design mock-up to ensure it contains all the provided features.
  - We learned that we should budget extra time in case modifications are needed to accommodate our requirements, such as adding missing database fields.

- **Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?** 
  - This is the first retrospective, so we didn't have any previous retrospective.

- **Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?**
  - This is the first retrospective, so we didn't have any previous retrospective.

- **Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)**
  - Improve the organization and the work for the code reviews and tests. To achieve this we will spend more time in the planning of tasks, taking also in consideration time for code review made by another team member, and provide a simple and clear code template to effectively run and test the code.
  - Improve the distribution of tasks based on their type and difficulty. To achieve this we will distribute for each team member tasks of each type (designing, implementation, documentation, testing) and difficulty.

- **One thing you are proud of as a Team!!**
  - We never had internal problems and confilcts and we always worked well together.
